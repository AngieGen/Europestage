            TK Events SIA operates TK Events. It is our policy to respect your
            privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
            websites.

          <h1>WEBSITE VISITORS</h1>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, TK Events collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how TK Events
            visitors use its website. From time to time, we may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
            publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            TK Events also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
            users and for users providing references in
            www.worldofdancelatvia.com profiles. TK Events only discloses
            logged in user and reference IP addresses under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
            information as described below.

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h1>GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h1>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to TK Events websites choose to interact with us
            in ways that require TK Events to gather personally-identifying
            information. The amount and type of information that TK Events
            gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
            ask visitors who sign up for an online account at
            www.worldofdancelatvia.com to provide a username and email address.
            Those who engage in providing comments also provide additional
            information. In each case, TK Events collects such information only
            insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the
            visitor’s interaction with TK Events. TK Events does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below.
            And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
            information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging
            in certain website-related activities.

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h1>AGGREGATED STATISTICS</h1>
          <p>
            TK Events may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to
            its websites. For instance, TK Events may monitor the most popular
            Profiles on the www.worldofdancelatvia.com site. TK Events may
            display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
            TK Events does not disclose personally-identifying information
            other than as described below.

          <h1>PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h1>
          <p>
            TK Events discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on TK Events behalf or to
            provide services available at TK Events websites, and (ii) that
            have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
            your home country; by using TK Events websites, you consent to the
            transfer of such information to them. TK Events will not rent or
            sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
            affiliated organizations, as described above, TK Events discloses
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
            legal requests, or when TK Events believes in good faith that
            disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
            of TK Events, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
            registered user of TK Events website and have supplied your email
            address, TK Events may occasionally send you an email to tell you
            about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
            date with what’s going on with TK Events and our products. We
            primarily use our various product pages to communicate this type of
            information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
            of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it to
            help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
            other users. TK Events takes all measures reasonably necessary to
            protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
            destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.
